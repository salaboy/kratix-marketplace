# BETA- DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
# Vault Namespaces

This Promise provides Vault-Namespaces-as-a-Service for Vault Enterprise. The
Promise has 3 fields:
* `.spec.team` the name of the team (used to create the namespace)
* `.spec.kubernetes.host` and `.spec.kubernetes.caCert`. The cluster to grant
  access to vault. Only service account in the team namespace within this
  cluster will have access.

To install:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/main/vault-namespace/promise.yaml
```

In order for the namepaces to be provisioned, you need to ensure you have setup your
platform cluster to have access to Vault using the [Kubernetes auth](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes) method.
Once auth is setup, create a Role within Vault for Kratix to use to provision the namespaces:
```
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/kratix \
    bound_service_account_names=vaultnamespace-default-promise-pipeline \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    policies=NAMESPACE_POLICY \
    ttl=1h
```

The pipeline will use the `vaultnamespace-default-promise-pipeline` Service
Account to authenticate with vault. Replace NAMESPACE_POLICY with a policy that
can create Vault Namespaces, KV and Auth engines.

Note: the default endpoint is `auth/kubernetes/login`. If this auth method was enabled
at a different path, use that value instead of kubernetes.

Create a config map `vault` with the address of your vault instance:

```
kubectl create configmap vault \ 
    --from-literal=url=$VAULT_ADDR \
    --from-literal=role=kratix \
    --from-literal=parentNamespace=admin \
    --from-literal=authpath=kubernetes
```

Replacing
* VAULT_ADDR with your Vault instance URL. If you are running both Kratix on KinD and Vault locally, use `http://host.docker.internal:PORT'.

To make a resource request:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syntasso/kratix-marketplace/main/vault-namespace/resource-request.yaml
```

Once the pipeline is executed, the namespace is ready to be used and the Kubernetes cluster
is configured to authenticate with the Vault namespace.
